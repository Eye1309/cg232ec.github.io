I, along with a team developed a food picker wheel app designed to simplify meal selection. The app allows users to input a list of food options, then spin a virtual wheel to randomly
select a meal. The user-friendly interface ensures a smooth experience, while the underlying algorithm ensures fairness in selection. This project showcases my skills in app development,
problem-solving, and user experience design, as it addresses the common challenge of indecisiveness when choosing what to eat.
