 I upgraded a LEGO EV3 robot, significantly enhancing its task performance by 95%. The original build struggled with accuracy and speed in completing tasks such as object detection and navigation. By refining the design, optimizing the motor configurations, and improving the sensor integration, I achieved a substantial increase in efficiency and precision. These upgrades not only demonstrated my ability to troubleshoot and innovate but also highlighted my skills in engineering and robotics.
